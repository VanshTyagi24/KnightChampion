# KnightChampion
Hello Folks!!!!
- This is a project called Knight Champion.
- I used Spring Framework to code this.
- We have all played chess at some point in our life.
- There is a piece in chess called "Knight".
- This piece moves in "L" direction on the board.
- In this project, we are giving an initial position to knight on the chess board.
- And we want knight to choose a path so that it makes atleast 55 moves on the board.
- The knight cannot move to a same box on the board twice.
- To play this game of Knight Champion, you'll need IntelliJ IDE.
- Open this project on IntelliJ IDE as a maven project and download all the resources prompted by IntelliJ.
- Run this project. 
- Open any browser and type in localhost:8080
- Enjoy the game.üêé
